# SRGAN Introduction
Welcome to my SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) repository!
SRGAN is a deep learning-based approach to perform single image super-resolution. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution images. 

The SRGAN model is trained on pairs of low-resolution and high-resolution images, where the goal is to learn a mapping function from the low-resolution space to the high-resolution space. Once trained, the SRGAN model can be used to generate 128x128 sized images from 32x32 sized images.

In this repository, I'll provide an implementation of the SRGAN model using TensorFlow and Keras. The implementation includes the generator and discriminator models, as well as the training loop to train the models on your own data. This script was done through Google Colab.
